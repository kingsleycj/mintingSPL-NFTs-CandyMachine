# Minting of SPL Tokens and then; NFTs using Metaplex Candy Machine

In this project, we bring together our learning to create a Candy Machine UI for the Candy Machine NFT Contract deployed and minted on Solana. The twist? Users will pay in a custom SPL token to mint NFTs.

## Overview

To accomplish this assignment, we'll go through the following steps:

1. **Create an SPL Token**: Utilize lessons learned or use a previously created SPL token.
2. **Update Config**: Adjust `config.json` to use the SPL token's address.
3. **Create Candy Machine UI**: Follow the tutorial in [Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solana-development/nfts/how-to-deploy-an-nft-collection-on-solana-using-sugar-candy-machine) to set up the UI.
4. **Fix Start Script**: Change the start script in `package.json` to prevent an `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` error.
    ```json
    "start": "export SET NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider && craco start"
    ```
5. **Run the UI**: Ensure users can mint NFTs by paying with the custom SPL token.

## Worthy Notes

For the `config.json` file:
- The `splToken` = mint token address
- The `splTokenAccount` = The token address that will recieve the minted token and holds its quantity amount
- The `creator.address` = The owner's address

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Create an SPL Token

Create a new SPL token or utilize an existing one.

### 2. Update Config

In `config.json`, modify the `splTokenAddress` to reflect the address of the SPL token created in Step 1.

### 3. Create Candy Machine UI

Follow the tutorial [here](https://www.quicknode.com/guides/solana-development/nfts/how-to-deploy-an-nft-collection-on-solana-using-sugar-candy-machine) to create a UI for the Candy Machine. Note the adjustment required for the start script.

### 4. Fix Start Script

Change the start script in `package.json` as mentioned above to avoid `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` error during UI startup.

### 5. Run the UI

Ensure the Candy Machine UI is running smoothly, and users can mint NFTs by paying with the custom SPL token.

## Additional Notes

- Test thoroughly by transferring or minting the SPL token to a Phantom account and attempting to mint NFTs on the website.
- Consider adjusting the mint function in the SPL project to mint to your Phantom address or modifying the transfer function to transfer to your Phantom wallet.
